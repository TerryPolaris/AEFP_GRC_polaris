A Minimal Meta-Framework for Observation Systems

This repository is based on a minimal structural principle:

S → 𝒢(S) → Φ(𝒢, S) → O

Where:
	•	S (Source): data, signals, events, records, evidence
	•	𝒢(S) (Geometry): the representational structure induced by S
	•	Φ (Propagation): dynamics within that structure (flows, reasoning, evolution)
	•	O (Observables): human-facing outputs (interpretations, narratives, measurements)

This framework models any system in which raw data is transformed into observable meaning through an intermediate structural layer.

Interpretation

The core idea is:

Observables are not direct functions of data.
They are projections of dynamics evolving inside induced geometries.

Formally:

O = Π ∘ Φ ∘ 𝒢 [S]

Where Π denotes a projection or observation operator.

AEFP / GRC Mapping

This structure is compatible with the AEFP / GRC decomposition:
	•	AEFP: Actor / Event / Frame / Pattern
(minimal grammar of observable structure)
	•	GRC: Grammar / Resilience / Context
(stability conditions of interpretation)

Together, they describe how systems generate meaning, coherence, and dynamics from distributed sources.

Scope

This meta-framework applies across domains:
	•	Physics: mass → spacetime → motion → measurement
	•	AI: data → representation space → inference → outputs
	•	OSINT: evidence → narrative geometry → analysis → explanations
	•	Social systems: information → institutional structure → belief dynamics → public narratives

Core Principle

What governs system behavior is not events, but the geometry that propagates them.

This repository treats geometry (𝒢) and propagation (Φ) as first-class objects of analysis, rather than secondary artifacts.

The goal is not to model specific outcomes, but to make the structure of observation itself explicit and computable.
