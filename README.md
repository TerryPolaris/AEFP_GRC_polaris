A Minimal Meta-Framework for Observation Systems

This repository is based on a minimal structural principle:

S → 𝒢(S) → Φ(𝒢, S) → O

Where:
	•	S (Source): data, signals, events, records, evidence
	•	𝒢(S) (Geometry): the representational structure induced by S
	•	Φ (Propagation): dynamics within that structure (flows, reasoning, evolution)
	•	O (Observables): human-facing outputs (interpretations, narratives, measurements)

I am Terry, an independent researcher and designer exploring the foundations of intelligence, computation, and structure.

Currently, I am developing experimental AGI-related systems using mid-grade personal hardware at home. Rather than approaching AGI purely as a software engineering problem, I treat it as a structural and physical question—one that must ultimately align with the same underlying principles that govern the universe.

I use large language models as computational instruments to explore connections across domains, including social narratives, physics, mathematical operators, quantum concepts, philosophy, and symbolic systems. Through this interdisciplinary approach, I investigate structural invariants and boundary conditions—such as the potential role of inverse-square relationships (r⁻²) as stabilizing limits within dynamic systems.

My work integrates operator theory, functional systems, Lie group dynamics, and a conceptual framework I refer to as AEFP-GRC, which serves as a structural bridge between language models, adaptive AI systems, and potential AGI architectures.

My long-term goal is not simply to build intelligence, but to ensure that such systems can serve real human needs—especially in areas such as survival, cognition, and memory continuity.

This path is long, experimental, and uncertain. But I believe it is worth walking.
